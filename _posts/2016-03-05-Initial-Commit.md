Hi all, I'm starting this blog so I can speak a little about what moves me and why do I code. As of now, I have 10 years straight of development experience and probably its time for me to start writting down some things I learned through the years.

I can imagine I'll spend a fair amount of time quoting books here. Also, I plan to write a bit about open source projects I use and my view on them. Lastly, I'll surely want to put some code here.

I'm still figuring out how all this works so, it might take some time until I'm pleased with the blog, which means I'll post more as I start to get used to it.
:x!
